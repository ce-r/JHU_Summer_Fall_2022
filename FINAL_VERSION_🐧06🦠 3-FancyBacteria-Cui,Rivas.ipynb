Different regularization, initializer, and optimizer were also experimented with various settings to improve the model performance. We used the partial function to organize the DNN code to maintain the cleanness of the code. Early stopping callback is implemented to reduce the DNN training time.\n","<br></br>\n","2. As mentioned in the Task 1 section, we first used \"accuracy\" and \"loss\" metrics to evaluate the prediction model. However, we discovered that the \"accuracy\" score severely mismatched the actual prediction result and the scores on the Kaggle. Therefore, we used \"MSE\" and \"Sparse Categorical Accuracy\" to measure the performance in the end.\n","<br></br>\n","3. Relu and ELU regularizers didn't seem to perform well in the bacteria dataset. He initializer did not outperform the Lecun normal. Early stopping callback reduces the training time significantly, but sometimes the training stops too early.
