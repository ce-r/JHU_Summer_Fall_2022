The preprocessing pipeline is composed of an outlier filter, a preprocessing function, and a polynomial featurization transformer. First, the data is put through an outlier filter that removes data points outside of 3 standard deviations of the mean. Then, the data is put through a preprocessing function. This function first one hot encodes the categorical features, then ordinally encodes the categorical features and then defines the ratios of these encoded features to the \"carat\" feature. After this, the \"depth\" feature is dropped because it is not correlated with the target variable (and thus adds noise), and the categorical features are dropped (because we found we only need the ratios instead of the encoded features). Next, the data is transformed using a degree 2 polynomial transformer. Finally, the data is ready for input into the model.\n","\n","2. After a significant amount of trial and error, we learned that the linear regression models perform better when the categorical data is one hot encoded instead of ordinally encoded. However, from research we found that computing the ratio of cut, color, and clarity to the carat feature is signficiant, so we decided to ordinally encode the categorical features to compute the ratio (and later dropped the encoding). We decided to drop the \"depth\" feature because it does not appear to be corrleated with the target variable. Finally, we decided to transform the data with a polynomial transformer at the end purely from trial and error. Several other models we developed that did not include this element showed poor performance (~1100 MAE) but once the data was transformed using the polynomial transformer we found much better results.\n","\n","3. We evaluated the effectiveness of these elements by removing elements one at a time and looking at how the model performance changes. Adding the polynomial transformer at the end of the pipeline made a big difference in model performance, although the data loses some intepretability because of the complex transformation. \n","\n","4. Several different pipelines were attempted before reaching the final version. These pipelines contained a mixture of one hot encoding, ordinal encoding, feature shifting, logarithmic feature scaling, and polynomial transformation. We also attempted to use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, but it did not yield much better results. Other types of feature engineering were also attempted, including computing the volume of the diamond from the x, y, and z features.

Tune model hyperparameters\n","1. Try to linear and non-linear feature normalization: shift/scale, log, divide features by features (investigate scatterplot matrix)\n","1. Try 3rd order feature interactions and polynomial features on a small subsample. Then identify key features or select key principal components. The final model can be trained on a larger or even full training sample. You can use [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) to reduce the feature set\n","1. Do a thorough EDA and understand non-linear relation in I/O. Are any interactions more special than others (E.g. is diamond *volume* a better predictor?)\n","1. If you note a shift in trend for any predictors, try building a model for each trend.\n","1. Evaluate predictions and focus on poorly predicted \"groups\". Can they be identified and modeled separately?\n","1. Do scatter plots show piecewise linear shape? Can a separate linear model be used on each support of approximately linear X-Y relation?\n","1. How are categorical features treated by the SKLearn models? Is there a [better way](https://www.google.com/search?q=ways+to+encode+categorical+data) to encode these (perhaps, ordinal) features? \n","  1. E.g. you could replace codes (or groups of codes) with their frequencies, which may capture the implied \"distance\" or rarity between category levels.\n","  1.
